<!-- To complete HW2, choose a content theme of your favorite animal. -->
<!--  1. Write your document type declaration -->
<!--  2. At the same level, write your "html" element -->

<!-- =======================================================================
      HEAD
     =======================================================================
      3. Nested within the <html> element, write your <head> element. 
        4. Nested within the <head> element, include the following:
          - Using the <title> element, provide a meaningful title for the page
          - Provide at least 5 <meta> elements the describe aspects (metadata) 
            about the page: https://www.metatags.org/all-meta-tags-overview/the-important-meta-tags/
          - Be sure that your indentation scheme represents the parent-child
            relationships.
          - Be sure that all of your elements are properly opened and closed.
  ==========================================================================-->

<!-- =======================================================================
      BODY
     =======================================================================
      5. After the head element, and at the same level of it, write your 
        "body" element. 
        6. Nested within the <body> element, include the following:
          - <nav>, <header>, <article>, and a <footer>
        7. Decide what fictional pages to write properly in the <nav>.
            - Be sure to include mock <a> inline elements with the proper 
              attributes. You can write in a '#' for the link.
        8. Nested within the <header>, write an <h1> to introduce the page to 
            your audience.
            - Take a cue from Simmons (3.3) and write an <h1> tag that requires 
              a set of ARIA role attributes to make it accessible for screen 
              readers.
        9. Nested within the <article>, write a <h2>, <p>, and 2 <section> 
            elements.
        10. Nested within those <section> elements, include the next meaningful
            heading element and any other combination of elements that you 
            would like to practice herein, e.g., <blockquote>, 
        11. Nested within the <footer>, write some information using the 
            following:
            - Appropriate heading element
            - <p> and a list
            - <span> and some special characters
            - <time>
        12. Go back through your markup and write helpful id attributes on some
          select HTML elements --  NOT all of them!
            - Consider how id attributes must be unique, and how they also help 
              with (keyboard) navigation.
        
        
  - Be sure that your indentation scheme represents the parent-child
    relationships.
  - Be sure that all of your elements are properly opened and closed.
  - Be sure to remove these comments so your code looks more "clean."
  - Finally, submit this HW2 **ON** the due date: 11/02. **NOT** before it.

          that men who grown out their facial hair are 20% happier
